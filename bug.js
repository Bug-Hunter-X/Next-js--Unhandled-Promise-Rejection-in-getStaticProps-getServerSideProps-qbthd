In Next.js, a relatively uncommon bug can arise from incorrect usage of the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions, specifically when dealing with asynchronous operations and data fetching.  For example, if an API call within these functions fails to handle errors properly, it can lead to unexpected behavior, such as rendering errors or blank pages. This is particularly challenging to debug because the error might not manifest as a typical JavaScript error, but rather as a failure to display content.
